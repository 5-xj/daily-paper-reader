## Abstract
The calibration of simulators for complex social systems aims to identify the optimal parameter that drives the output of the simulator best matching the target data observed from the system. As many social systems may change internally over time, calibration naturally becomes an online task, requiring parameters to be updated continuously to maintain the simulator's fidelity. In this work, the online setting is first formulated as a dynamic optimization problem (DOP), requiring the search for a sequence of optimal parameters that fit the simulator to real system changes. However, in contrast to traditional DOP formulations, online calibration explicitly incorporates the observational data as the driver of environmental dynamics. Due to this fundamental difference, existing Evolutionary Dynamic Optimization (EDO) methods, despite being extensively studied for black-box DOPs, are ill-equipped to handle such a scenario. As a result, online calibration problems constitute a new set of challenging DOPs. Here, we propose to explicitly learn the posterior distributions of the parameters and the observational data, thereby facilitating both change detection and environmental adaptation of existing EDOs for this scenario. We thus present a pretrained posterior model for implementation, and fine-tune it during the optimization. Extensive tests on both economic and financial simulators verify that the posterior distribution strongly promotes EDOs in such DOPs widely existed in social science.
