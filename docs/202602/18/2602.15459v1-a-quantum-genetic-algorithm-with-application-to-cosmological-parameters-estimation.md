## Abstract
An Amplitude-Encoded Quantum Genetic Algorithm (AEQGA) has been developed to minimize $χ^2$ functions of different cosmological probes (Supernovae Type Ia, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation), to find the best-fit value for two cosmological parameters, namely the Hubble Constant and the density matter content of the Universe today. Our main aim is to pave the way to testing the adoption of quantum optimization in the inference of the cosmological parameters that describe the universe evolution. AEQGA computes the merit function classically, and then uses a quantum circuit to entangle the population and perform crossover and mutation operations. The results show consistency with the isocontours of the objective functions. We then tested the general behavior of AEQGA as a function of its hyperparameters and compared it with a second quantum genetic algorithm found in the literature as well as with classical algorithms, finding consistent results.
