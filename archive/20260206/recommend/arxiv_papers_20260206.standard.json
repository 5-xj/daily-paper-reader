      "title": "Mining Generalizable Activation Functions",
      "abstract": "The choice of activation function is an active area of research, with different proposals aimed at improving optimization, while maintaining expressivity. Additionally, the activation function can significantly alter the implicit inductive bias of the architecture, controlling its non-linear behavior. In this paper, in line with previous work, we argue that evolutionary search provides a useful framework for finding new activation functions, while we also make two novel observations. The first is that modern pipelines, such as AlphaEvolve, which relies on frontier LLMs as a mutator operator, allows for a much wider and flexible search space; e.g., over all possible python functions within a certain FLOP budget, eliminating the need for manually constructed search spaces. In addition, these pipelines will be biased towards meaningful activation functions, given their ability to represent common knowledge, leading to a potentially more efficient search of the space. The second observation is that, through this framework, one can target not only performance improvements but also activation functions that encode particular inductive biases. This can be done by using performance on out-of-distribution data as a fitness function, reflecting the degree to which the architecture respects the inherent structure in the data in a manner independent of distribution shifts. We carry an empirical exploration of this proposal and show that relatively small scale synthetic datasets can be sufficient for AlphaEvolve to discover meaningful activations.",

      "abstract": "DARWIN is an evolutionary GPT model, utilizing a genetic-algorithm like optimization structure with several independent GPT agents being trained individually using unique training code. Each iteration, the GPT models are prompted to modify the training code of one another in an attempt to improve their performance in a mutation-like manner, and the best GPT agents are then benchmarked and selected for the next iteration by genetic algorithm. For demonstration purposes and due to budget and time constraints, OpenAI API is used to prompt training code improvements and the nanoGPT framework is used as the training code. DARWIN also utilizes persistent JSON-based memory files to track previous reasoning and changes to code to correlate with improvement to model performance. and a bidirectional interface for HITL intervention allowing the model to request upgrades such as additional datasets, training scripts, and restructuring of file hierarchies. In experiments, DARWIN achieved a 1.26 percent improvement in model FLOPS utilization (MFU) and a 2.07 percent improvement to perplexity in 5 iterations of training over baseline configurations, demonstrating promising capabilities as a foundation for scaling evolutionary GPT training.",

      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, research in evolutionary multi-objective optimization has predominantly focused on continuous domains, with comparatively limited attention given to multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs). Combinatorial problems differ significantly from continuous ones in terms of problem structure and landscape. Recent studies have shown that on MOCOPs multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) can even be outperformed by simple randomised local search. Starting with a randomly sampled solution in search space, randomised local search iteratively draws a random solution (from an archive) to perform local variation within its neighbourhood. However, in most existing methods, the local variation relies on a fixed neighbourhood, which limits exploration and makes the search easy to get trapped in local optima. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective local search method, called variable stepsize randomized local search (VS-RLS), which adjusts the stepsize during the search. VS-RLS transitions gradually from a broad, exploratory search in the early phases to a more focused, fine-grained search as the search progresses. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of VS-RLS through extensive evaluations against local search and MOEAs methods on diverse MOCOPs.",

We find that the SMAC method clearly outperforms all the other considered methods. We further observe that (i) a relatively large number of trials larger than $100$ is required for accurate tuning, (ii) using default values for hyperparameters yields very inaccurate models, (iii) all considered hyperparameters can have a material effect on the accuracy of tree-boosting, i.e., there is no small set of hyperparameters that is more important than others, and (iv) choosing the number of boosting iterations using early stopping yields more accurate results compared to including it in the search space for regression tasks.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous agents excel in self-improvement through reflection and iterative refinement, which reuse successful task trajectories as in-context examples to assist subsequent reasoning. However, shifting across tasks often introduces a context mismatch. Hence, existing approaches either discard the trajectories or manipulate them using heuristics, leading to a non-negligible fine-tuning cost or unguaranteed performance. To bridge this gap, we reveal a context-trajectory correlation, where shifts of context are highly parallel with shifts of trajectory. Based on this finding, we propose BrIdge contextual gap FoR imprOvised trajectory STeering (Bifrost), a training-free method that leverages context differences to precisely guide the adaptation of previously solved trajectories towards the target task, mitigating the misalignment caused by context shifts. Our trajectory adaptation is conducted at the representation level using agent hidden states, ensuring trajectory transformation accurately aligns with the target context in a shared space. Across diverse benchmarks, Bifrost consistently outperforms existing trajectory reuse and finetuned self-improvement methods, demonstrating that agents can effectively leverage past experiences despite substantial context shifts.",

      "abstract": "We study adaptive learning rate scheduling for norm-constrained optimizers (e.g., Muon and Lion). We introduce a generalized smoothness assumption under which local curvature decreases with the suboptimality gap and empirically verify that this behavior holds along optimization trajectories. Under this assumption, we establish convergence guarantees under an appropriate choice of learning rate, for which warm-up followed by decay arises naturally from the proof rather than being imposed heuristically.   Building on this theory, we develop a practical learning rate scheduler that relies only on standard hyperparameters and adapts the warm-up duration automatically at the beginning of training. We evaluate this method on large language model pretraining with LLaMA architectures and show that our adaptive warm-up selection consistently outperforms or at least matches the best manually tuned warm-up schedules across all considered setups, without additional hyperparameter search.

      "abstract": "Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising paradigm for enhancing GUI agents through direct environment interaction. However, its effectiveness is severely hindered by inefficient credit assignment in long-horizon tasks and repetitive errors across tasks due to the lack of experience transfer. To address these challenges, we propose UI-Mem, a novel framework that enhances GUI online RL with a Hierarchical Experience Memory. Unlike traditional replay buffers, our memory accumulates structured knowledge, including high-level workflows, subtask skills, and failure patterns. These experiences are stored as parameterized templates that enable cross-task and cross-application transfer. To effectively integrate memory guidance into online RL, we introduce Stratified Group Sampling, which injects varying levels of guidance across trajectories within each rollout group to maintain outcome diversity, driving the unguided policy toward internalizing guided behaviors. Furthermore, a Self-Evolving Loop continuously abstracts novel strategies and errors to keep the memory aligned with the agent's evolving policy. Experiments on online GUI benchmarks demonstrate that UI-Mem significantly outperforms traditional RL baselines and static reuse strategies, with strong generalization to unseen applications.
